# How it works

Using the command /gui you provide your preferences for the GUI
such as:
- amount of rows
- Name of the inventory
- method of gui creation (metadata or Local variables)

After you have entered your preferences, just run the command 
Next, an empty gui will be opened to you, all you have to do from then
is drag and drop ur items in and design your gui

after you finish designing, close your inventory
and the code for the GUI you just created will be auto-generated
and placed in a file named gui.txt
you can location this file in the /home pathway
(basically if u just click files or file manager on your console and scroll down you will find it)

From there, you can copy and paste the function and do as you please.
